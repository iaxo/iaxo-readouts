## Veto readout

The veto readout is defined from the position, orientation and dimensions of the multiple veto slabs.

These are defined in the geometry (gdml) file, but it is not easy to access this information here.

REST-for-Physics stores some additional information inside the `TRestGeant4Metadata` class. Using this information we
can construct the veto readout.
